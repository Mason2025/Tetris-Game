# Tetris-Game

Recreation of the classic arcade game Tetris. Random blocks will fall at a set pace that increases as you pass score increments. The player will use three buttons to control the blocks. Score is received by filling up a row on the grid in which it will empty the row and all blocks above will go down a row. The game is over when a block goes past the top border of the grid when it is finished moving.
